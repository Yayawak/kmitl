    \textbf{
        Prove that
        $
        \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{e^x}{x^n} = \infty
        $
        for any positve interget $n$. This shows that the exponential function approaces infinity faster tahn any powe rof $x$.

if we give $x_1 = 1$ then $f^{'}(x_1) = f^{'}(1) = 3(1)^2 - 3 = 0$
or we cannot find $x_2$ by using newton's method because it will divides by 0 causes a crucial singularity
\\
Hence Newton's method can' use to find root of this equation
