\subsection*{A : State the First Derivative test}
The fist derivative test is \textbf{
    the process of analyzing functions using theris first derivatives in order to find their extremum point
}

\subsection*{A : State the Second Derivative Test. Under what circumstances is it inconclusive? What do you do if it fails.}
The second derivative test stats that if $f(x) has a stattionary point when $x = c$ and if $f^{''}(c) = 0$ then \textbf{the test is inconclusive} and we should study the sign of the first derivative
